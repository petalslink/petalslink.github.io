# Current Repositories

As Petals suite is divided in many sub-projects, history separated them over several repositories.
In the next months, we plan a full reorganization of our source code infrastructure around one central solution: Git. For now, use the following to check out the code.

+ Source code for Petals ESB, Petals Components and Web Tools is located on Subversion.<br />[https://svn.petalslink.org/svnroot/trunk/product/dev/prod/](https://svn.petalslink.org/svnroot/trunk/product/dev/prod/ "Petals ESB and components source repository")<br />

+ Source code for latest Petals components, Petals demo tools, Petals dockerization projects is located on Github.com.<br />[https://github.com/petalslink](https://github.com/petalslink "Linagora's Github organisation")<br />

+ Source code for Petals Studio is on GitHub.<br />[https://github.com/petalslink/petals-studio](https://github.com/petalslink/petals-studio "Petals Studio source repository")

+ Source code for Petals Cockpit is on GitLab.<br />
[https://gitlab.com/linagora/petals-cockpit/](https://gitlab.com/linagora/petals-cockpit/ "Petals Cockpit's sources")

# Old Repositories

These are the repositories to look for if you want to get source code for older releases of Petals products.

+ Source code for Petals ESB and Petals Components (<= Petals 3.0).<br />[https://svnlegacy.ow2.org/svnroot/petals/](https://svnlegacy.ow2.org/svnroot/petals/ "Archived OW2's repository for Petals ESB")
